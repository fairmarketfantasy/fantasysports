<h3>Terms and Conditions of the Subscription fee</h3>

<p>By paying the monthly $10 subscription fee and agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, the User will be allowed to enter all contests and to make all predictions on PredictThat for free with nothing at stake or at risk. The user will additionally be able to access all information on event probabilities generated by PredictThat contests and predictions, and they will be allowed to chat on the site about the relevant events (subject to rules of our chat rooms). All contest prizes won will be in denominated in Fanbucks and tallied on a monthly basis and will be reduced by a 15 Fanbuck charge per contest entered or prediction made . At the end of the calendar month, if the Fanbuck balance is positive, PredictThat will award the user with the same amount in dollars and reset the Fanbuck balance to zero. To the extent that the Fanbuck balance is negative, it will be rolled over into the following month with a maximum negative balance of negative 50 Fanbucks.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each month, PredictThat will deduct the $10 subscription fee from the user's account balance if there is a sufficient balance. To the extent the balance is insufficient to pay the subscription fee, FMF will require the user to pay the balance of the subscription fee when the User next visits the site. At any point in time, the User can terminate this subscription agreement by using a button marked Terminate Subscription right below.</p>

<p>Alternate Entry, Mail In Option</p>
<p>No purchase is required to enter the contests or make predictions on the PredictThat site. An alternate means of entering contests is to signup on the PredictThat site and 15 days prior to the any month that you intend to participate, send a 3 x 5 inch card on which the player has legibly handwritten the player's PredictThat user name, First and Last Name, Complete Mailing Address (eg Street, City, State, Zip Code), Email Address, Date of Birth with a photocopy of Driver's License or other photo ID with the month that you intend to participate in mm/yyyy format. The card must be place in a #10 envelope and mailed to PO Box 399 Ross CA 94957. No photo copies, reproductions or facsimiles or the 3inch x 5 inch card are allowed. Limit 1 card per envelope.</p>
<p><b>Entries using the Altenate Entry Mail in Option will have the exact same chance of winning as if that same entry was made by a user using the regular Subscription. However, Users using the Altenate Entry will not be able to access the chat rooms, or see related content, including but not limited to player notes, probabilities, articles, statistics and past performances and might be on a site with more ads and a slower server.</b></p>
