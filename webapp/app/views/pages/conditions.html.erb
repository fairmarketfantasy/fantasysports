<h3>Terms and Conditions of the Subsription fee</h3>

<p>By paying the monthly $10 subscription fee and agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, the User will be allowed to enter all contests and to make all predictions on FMF for free with nothing at stake or at risk. The user will additionally be able to access all information on event probabilities generated by FMF contests and predictions, and they will be allowed to chat on the site about the relevant events (subject to rules of our chat rooms). All contest prizes won will be in denominated in fanbucks and tallied on a monthly basis and will be reduced by a 15 fanbuck charge per contest entered or prediction made to reach a Net Monthly Winning (NMW) balance for the User. The NMW balance will be reduced at the end of the month by 25% of the amount by which is exceeds 100 fanbucks, an additional 25% of the amount by which it exceeds 300 fanbucks, and an additional 25% by the amount it exceeds 500 fanbucks, such amounts to be calculated concurrently, such reductions called Give Backs. After such Give Backs, the remaining NMW, if positive, will be converted into dollars on a one to one basis and deposited in the User's account balance. The amount of the Give Backs will be combined with Give Backs from the other user accounts and will be used solely to supplement normal contest prizes in special contests at the end of the following month that will be limited to users with negative NMW balances at that time (Last Chance Contests).  To the extent that the NMW is negative, it will be rolled over into the following month as the beginning NMW for that month</p>
<p>At the beginning of each month, FMF will deduct the $10 subscription fee from the user's account balance if there is a sufficient balance. To the extent the balance is insufficient to pay the subscription fee, FMF will require the user to pay the balance of the subscription fee when the User next visits the site. At any point in time, the User can terminate this subscription agreement by using a button marked Terminate Subscription right below.</p>
