  <h3>Terms and Conditions of Subscription</h3>

  <p>By paying the monthly $10 subscription fee and agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, the User will be able to access all the content on an adfree service with information on event probabilities generated by PredictThat predictions, and they will be allowed to chat on the site about the relevant events (subject to rules of our chat rooms). Additionally, all Users, whether paid subscribers or using the Alternate Free Subcription method will be allowed to make all predictions on PredictThat for free with nothing at stake or at risk.  All awards for correct predictions will be denominated in Fanbucks and tallied on a monthly basis and will be reduced by a 15 Fanbuck charge per prediction made. At the end of the calendar month, if the Fanbuck balance is positive, PredictThat will award the user with the same amount in dollars and reset the Fanbuck balance to zero. To the extent that the Fanbuck balance is negative, it will be rolled over into the following month with a maximum negative balance of negative 50 Fanbucks.</p>
  <p>At the beginning of each calendar month, PredictThat will deduct the $10 subscription fee from the user's account balance if there is a sufficient balance. To the extent the balance is insufficient to pay the subscription fee, PredictThat will require the user to pay the balance of the subscription fee when the User next visits the site in order to gain access to the site and its content. At any point in time, the User can terminate this subscription agreement by using a button marked Terminate Subscription right below.</p>
  <a class="btn btn-mini btn-success" ng-show="currentUser" href="javascript://" ng-click="unsubscribe()">Unsubscribe</a>
  <p>No purchase is required to make predictions on the PredictThat site. An alternate means of making predictions is to signup on the PredictThat site and 15 days prior to the any month that you intend to participate, send a 3 x 5 inch card on which the user has legibly handwritten the user's PredictThat user name, First and Last Name, Complete Mailing Address (eg Street, City, State, Zip Code), Email Address, Date of Birth with a photocopy of Driver's License or other photo ID with the month that you intend to participate in mm/yyyy format. The card must be placed in a #10 envelope and mailed to PO Box 399 Ross CA 94957. No photo copies, reproductions or facsimiles of the 3inch x 5 inch card are allowed. Limit 1 card per envelope.</p>
  <p><b>Entries using the Altenate Free Subscription Mail in Option will have the exact same chance of winning as if that same prediction was made by a user using the regular Subscription Method. However, Users using the Altenate Entry will not be able to access the chat rooms, or see related content, including but not limited to player notes, probabilities, articles, statistics and past performances and might be on a site with more ads and a slower server.</b></p>
