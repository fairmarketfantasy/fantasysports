<p>No purchase is required to make predictions on the PredictThat site. An alternate means of making predictions is to signup on the PredictThat site and 15 days prior to the any month that you intend to participate, send a 3 x 5 inch card on which the user has legibly handwritten the user's PredictThat user name, First and Last Name, Complete Mailing Address (eg Street, City, State, Zip Code), Email Address, Date of Birth with a photocopy of Driver's License or other photo ID with the month that you intend to participate in mm/yyyy format. The card must be placed in a #10 envelope and mailed to PO Box 399 Ross CA 94957. No photo copies, reproductions or facsimiles of the 3inch x 5 inch card are allowed. Limit 1 card per envelope.</p>
<p><b>Entries using the Altenate Free Subscription Mail in Option will have the exact same chance of winning as if that same prediction was made by a user using the regular Subscription Method. However, Users using the Altenate Entry will not be able to access the chat rooms, or see related content, including but not limited to player notes, probabilities, articles, statistics and past performances and might be on a site with more ads and a slower server.</b></p>
