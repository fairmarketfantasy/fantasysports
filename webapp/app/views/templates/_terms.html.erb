<p>Game of Skill</p>
<p>Fair Market Fantasy is a game of skill. Winners are determined by the criteria stated in each contest's rules. For each contest, winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant professional sports information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the most fantasy points. Fantasy points are accumulated through the performance of individual athletes on multiple teams to compete with other fantasy teams doing likewise.</p>
<p>Entry fees</p>
<p>Each Fair Market Fantasy contest has an entry fee listed in US dollars. When you opt to participate in a contest, that amount in US dollars will be debited from your Fair Market Fantasy account. Then, follow the links and instructions provided for entry. In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the person submitting an entry, the entry will be deemed submitted by the person in whose Username the entry was submitted, or if possession of the Username itself is contested, the name in which the email address on file was registered with the email service provider.</p>
<p>Contest Term</p>
<p>Fair Market Fantasy offers contests for multiple professional sports events taking place on a single day or at most a week.</p>
<p>Prizes</p>
<p>After each contest ends, prizes are awarded (generally by 10 AM ET the following day). The players in each contest who accumulate the most fantasy points will win prizes as set out in the posted contest details. Prizes are added to the winning team's account balance. In the event of a tie, the prize is divided evenly between the tied players, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Fair Market Fantasy offers a number of different types of contests. For each contest, we announce the entry fees and prizes in advance on the contest page. For a summary of entry fees and prizes for currently open contests please login and visit the user home page.</p>

<p>No substitution or transfer of prize is permitted. All taxes associated with the receipt or use of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of any prizes to winners of the Contest is challenged by any legal authority, Fair Market Fantasy reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award such prizes.</p>
<p>Notification</p>
<p>Winners are generally posted on the Fair Market Fantasy website after the conclusion of each contest by 10 AM ET on the following day. Winners may be requested to return via email or regular mail an affidavit of eligibility and appropriate tax forms. Failure to comply with this requirement can result in disqualification. Any prize notification returned as undeliverable may result in disqualification and selection of an alternate winner. In addition, a list of winners and winner's names for each competition period may be obtained by emailing to: Fair Market Fantasy, info@FairMarketFantasy.com.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</p>
<p>Initial Dispute Resolution: Our Customer Support Department is available by phone (917-525-4538) or via the web to address any concerns you may have regarding the Site. Our Customer Service Department is able to resolve most concerns quickly to our players’ satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts through this Customer Service process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
<p>Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Fair Market Fantasy will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Fair Market Fantasy will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
<p>Location. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents in Canada, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, and you and Fair Market Fantasy agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>Class Action Waiver. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND FAIR MARKET FANTASY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Fair Market Fantasy, Inc., 41 E 11th Street, 10th Floor, New York City, New York, NY10003 The notice must be sent within 30 days of 08/20/2013 or your first use of the Site, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
