<h3>Terms and Conditions of Subscription</h3>
<p>By paying the monthly $10 subscription fee and agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, the User will be able to access all the content on an adfree service with information on event probabilities generated by PredictThat predictions, and they will be allowed to chat on the site about the relevant events (subject to rules of our chat rooms). Additionally, all Users, whether paid subscribers or using the Alternate Free Subcription method will be allowed to make all predictions on PredictThat for free with nothing at stake or at risk.  All awards for correct predictions will be denominated in Fanbucks and tallied on a monthly basis and will be reduced by a 15 Fanbuck charge per prediction made. At the end of the calendar month, the Fanbuck balance will be reduced by 25% of the amount by which is exceeds 100 fanbucks, an additional 25% of the amount by which it exceeds 200 fanbucks, and an additional 25% by the amount it exceeds 300 fanbucks, and an additional 20% of the amount by which it exceeds 500 fanbucks, such amounts to be calculated concurrently, such reductions called Give Backs. After such Give Backs, the remaining Fanbuck balance will be converted into dollars on a one to one basis and deposited in the User's account balance. The amount of the Give Backs will be combined with Give Backs from the other user accounts and will be used solely to supplement normal contest prizes in special contests at the end of the following month that will be limited to users with negative Fanbuck balances at that time (Last Chance Contests). All Fanbuck balances will start the new calendar month at zero, ie. Positive fanbuck balances will be converted into dollars and moved into your account and negative fanbuck balances will be wiped out.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each calendar month, PredictThat will deduct the $10 subscription fee from the user's account balance if there is a sufficient balance. To the extent the balance is insufficient to pay the subscription fee, PredictThat will require the user to pay the balance of the subscription fee when the User next visits the site in order to gain access to the site and its content. At any point in time, the User can terminate this subscription agreement by using a button marked Terminate Subscription right below.</p>
