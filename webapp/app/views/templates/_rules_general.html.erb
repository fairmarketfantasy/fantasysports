<h3>Rules and Scoring</h3>
<p>In Predict That fantasy sports roster predictions you choose a new team every contest, up to a $100,000 salary cap, with player pricing based on market demand.</p>

<h4>Markets</h4>
<p>Prices are set based on user demand for each player, the more demand for a player, the higher the price goes. You can change your roster and trade back a player who is not locked (playing) and receive his current price and then purchase another player. If you purchase a player and then sell him back at a profit, it will raise your salary cap by that amount. Similarly, if you do so at a loss it will reduce your salary cap by that amount. Players are locked into your roster the minute their team begins its game. Up until that time you can trade back that player for any other unlocked player.</p>

<h4>Salary Cap</h4>
<p>While we call $100,000 the salary cap, it is not fixed. If you exceed the salary cap, we simply reduce the predict stats your team produces by the percent you exceeded the salary cap. Similarly, if you are below the salary cap we will increase your teamâ€™s predict stats by a maximum of 3%, ie., for any team salaries $97,000 or more.</p>
