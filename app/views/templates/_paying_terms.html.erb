<h3>Terms and Conditions of Membership</h3>
<p>By paying the monthly $10 Membership fee and agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, the User will establish a membership account and be able to access all the content on an adfree service with information on event probabilities generated by PredictThat predictions, and they will be allowed to chat on the site about the relevant events (subject to rules of our chat rooms). Additionally, all such  Users with Membership accounts, whether paid subscribers or using the Alternate Free Membership method will be allowed to make all predictions on PredictThat for free with nothing at stake or at risk.  All awards for correct predictions will be denominated in Fanbucks and tallied on a monthly basis and will be reduced by a 15 Fanbuck charge per prediction made. At the end of the calendar month, the Fanbuck balance will be reduced by 25% of the amount by which is exceeds 100 Fanbucks, an additional 25% of the amount by which it exceeds 200 Fanbucks, an additional 25% by the amount it exceeds 300 Fanbucks, and an additional 20% of the amount by which it exceed 500 Fanbucks, such amounts to be calculated concurrently, and such reductions called Give Backs. After such Give Backs, the remaining Fanbuck balance will be converted into dollars on a one to one basis and deposited in the User's account balance. The amount of the Give Backs will be combined with Give Backs from the other user accounts and will be used solely to supplement normal contest prizes in special contests at the end of the following month that will be limited to users with negative Fanbuck balances at that time (Last Chance Contests). All Fanbuck balances will start the new calendar month at zero, ie. Positive fanbuck balances will be converted into dollars and moved into your account and negative fanbuck balances will be wiped out.</p>
<p>Users utilizing the initial free trial will not have an account balance until they are members either through the paid subscription method or the Alternate Free Membership method. Any Fanbucks accumulated during the trial period are not eligible to be carried over into the Membership nor may they be converted into dollars as they would be for a Member account.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each calendar month, PredictThat will deduct the $10 Membeship fee from the user's account balance if there is a sufficient balance. To the extent the balance is insufficient to pay the Membership fee, PredictThat will require the user to pay the balance of the Membership Fee when the User next visits the site in order to gain access to the site and its content. At any point in time, the User can terminate this subscription agreement by using a button marked Terminate Subscription right below.</p>
<p>PredictThat reserves the right to terminate the membership for any User at any time in its sole discretion and refund the month's subscription fee. Users membership will be terminated for any of the following reasons (not exclusive), abusive behavior, misuse of chat, collusion, or any other behavior deemed not in concert with the fun and fair community nature the site is intended for.</p>
